**Introduction**

We attempt to solve the 9 questions as part of our assigment for the Introduction to Machine Learning class(ST 380). All the questions have been solved using Python on either Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio. Each question is embedded in a seperate folder, containing the ipynb file and a readme file, along with the relevant datasets or images wherever required.
